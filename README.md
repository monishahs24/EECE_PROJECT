# EECE_PROJECT
A low-power, ear-wearable device designed for non-invasive monitoring of Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂) and Heart Rate (HR). It uses the MAX3010x sensor and is specifically engineered for workers in low-ventilation environments, providing real-time data and safety alerts.
This repository contains the hardware schematics, mechanical design files, and firmware for the core monitoring functionality.
